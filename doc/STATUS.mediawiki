* double check
** Optional
** DestinationName
** DynamicDestinationName

* works
** ConnectionFactoryName
** MessageEvent (document!)
** JmsProperty

* needs rework
** JmsMapped/SerializedPayload
** JmsMappedName (rename to JmsName and add a ParameterNameSupplier for it)

* workaround
** JmsIncoming/Outgoing

* doesn't work
** JmsSelector

= TODO =
Bigger features still left to do:
*Find out if there is a way to register MDBs generated at startup; if there is, finish the dynamic generator and remove the incoming-processor.
*replyTo(this).callback(remoteBean.remoteMethod(request));
*For the FallbackParameterNameSupplier, instead of 'arg0' etc. take the type name and count only if it's not unique.
*Do we need custom payload handlers?
*Use JMS to call EJBs? Stateful? Request/Reply? Transactions?
*Multiple-Versions?
*Request-Reply-Token to authorize the service for the reply queue
