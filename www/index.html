Even Spring has not a solution  satisfying us, so we have started to develop the MessageApi as a remedy and just released version 1.0.</p><p>Motivation: The business code should concentrate on the message that is  to be sent or what it has to do when a message is received. What  technology is used, where the message is going or coming from, how the  message is encoded, etc. is to be provided by a configurable adapter  layer and injected into the business code.<br /></p> <p>We would like it to become a standard in some way (in some fits of megalomania I think it maybe even become JMS 2.0 :-), so we decided to make it publicly available so everybody can take a look at what we're up to. We welcome any feedback from feature requests to patches. </p>  <h3>Participation</h3>   <p>You can participate in a variety of ways.</p>   <ul>  <li>You can download the current release version or read documentation by clicking <a href="https://messageapi.dev.java.net/alm-process/servlets/ProjectDocumentList">here</a></li>   <li>You can subscribe to one of this project's mailing lists, by clicking <a href="https://messageapi.dev.java.net/alm-process/servlets/ProjectMailingListList">here</a></li>   <li>You can submit a project issue, or query existing issues, by clicking <a href="https://messageapi.dev.java.net/alm-process/servlets/ProjectIssues">here</a></li>   <li>You can access the Subversion repository, by clicking <a href="https://messageapi.dev.java.net/alm-process/source/browse/">here</a> </li>   <li>If you are not a member, you can request membership to this project <a href="https://messageapi.dev.java.net/alm-process/servlets/ProjectMembershipRequest">here</a>.</li>   <li>If you are a member, you can see the current list of members <a href="servlets/ProjectMemberList">here</a></li>  </ul>
