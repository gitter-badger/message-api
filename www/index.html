Even Spring has not a solution  satisfying us, so we (<a target="_blank" href="http://order.1and1.com">1&amp;1</a>) have started to develop the MessageApi as a remedy.</p> <p>We would like it to become a standard in some way (in some fits of  megalomania I think it maybe even become JMS 2.0 :-). We decided to  make it publicly available so everybody can take a look at what we're up to. We welcome any feedback - from feature requests to patches. </p>    <h3>Motivation</h3> <p>The business code should concentrate on the message that is  to be sent or what it has to do when a message is received. What  technology is used, where the message is going to or coming from, how the  message is transformed, etc. is to be provided by a configurable adapter  layer and injected into the business code.</p> <p>The idea is simple: You annotate an interface as @MessageApi. An annotation processor converts all your methods into POJOs, e.g. a method public void createCustomer(String firstName, String lastName) into a POJO with the two parameters as properties (i.e. it has a getFirstName() method), and properly annotations for JAXB. Some business code will get an proxy injected for that interface. If it calls e.g. the createCustomer message, the proxy converts the call into an instance of the POJO, serializes it using JAXB, queries a registry for the correct queue, and posts that message.</p>  <h3>Participation</h3> <p>You can participate in a variety of ways.</p>  <ul>   <li>You can download the current release version or read documentation by clicking <a href="https://messageapi.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectDocumentList">here</a>. Yes, this is participation, too: Without users, we won't get feedback.
