<h3>Project Description</h3>
<p>The EJB standard took a giant step between version 2.1 and 3.0 - the same step is (in our eyes) still missing in the JMS standard: To provide a simple to use, pure Java interface solution to remote calls... only asynchronous in this case. Even Spring has not a solution  satisfying us, so we at 1&amp;1 have started to develop this MessageApi.</p>

<p>We would like it to become a standard in some way (in some fits of  megalomania I think it maybe even become JMS 2.0 one day ;-). We decided to  make it publicly available so everybody can take a look at what we're up to.</p>

<p>We welcome any feedback - from feature requests to patches, from downloads to success stories. Yes, downloading is participation, too: Without users, we won't be able to get feedback, and having lot's of users and still no comments could mean that the project is just perfect ;-)</p>

<h3>Motivation</h3>
<p>Business code should concentrate on the message that is  to be sent or what it has to do when a message is received. What  technology is used, where the message is going to or coming from, how the  message is transformed, etc. is to be provided by a configurable adapter  layer and injected into the business code.</p>

<p>The idea is simple: You annotate an interface as <tt>@MessageApi</tt>. An annotation processor converts all your methods into POJOs, e.g. it transforms a method <tt>public void createCustomer(String firstName, String lastName)</tt> into a POJO with the two parameters as properties (i.e. it has a <tt>getFirstName()</tt> method). These POJOs are immutable, contain <tt>hashCode</tt>, <tt>equals</tt>, and <tt>toString</tt> methods, and are properly annotated for JAXB. You then package the interface, POJOs, and any helper classes into an API jar to be called by clients and implemented by services.</p>

<p>To use the MessageApi, the container injects a proxy for that interface into your business code, and if it calls e.g. the <tt>createCustomer</tt> method, the proxy converts the call into an instance of the POJO, marshalls it using JAXB, creates a text message, queries a registry for the correct queue, and posts the message. The business code can rely on two things: The call is asynchronous (i.e. only technical stuff happens within the method call that hardly fails) and the call is transactional (i.e. if the transaction fails for any reason, no message is sent).</p>

<p>On the receiver side, an MDB receives the message, unmarshals the POJO, and calls the corresponding method in your business code that implements the interface.</p>
